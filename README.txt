===== RUNNING THE GAME =====
Under Linux:

  python CosmicCommando.py

You need Python (2.7 works, other versions might too) and SDL.

Under Windows:

  CosmicCommando.exe

If you get a "MSVCR90.dll not found" error, you need to download the Microsoft
Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package. This is a Python runtime's
dependency.

===== TECHNOLOGY =====

The game is written in Python and uses the Doryen Library
(libtcod - http://doryen.eptalys.net/libtcod/).

Windows binary was created using py2exe (http://www.py2exe.org/).
