# Cosmic Commando

Tag v0.3 (first commit) has the original files from "Cosmic Commando (v0.3)[alpha].7z" (https://archive.org/details/ArchiveRL.7z).

I want to make the game run with Python 3.

Python 2 is no longer supported and installing it on Windows 10 Sandbox doesn't work.

Python 2 to Python 3 jumps is easier to make when replacing libtcodpy with python-tcod (I'm using Python 3.11.5 and tcod==16.1.1).
